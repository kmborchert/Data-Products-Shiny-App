Data-Products-Shiny-App
=======================

This repo contains both the code for my Shiny App for the Coursera Data Products Class (part of the Data Science Specialization) as well as a Slidify presentation for pitching the App.

The App I developed is called the Beer to Burpee Calculator.  It takes the user's weight and beer consumption (number and type) and outputs the number of Burpees (a form of exercise) one needs to do to burn the calories consumed by drinking said beer.

I developed this App because I love both Burpees and Beer.  I hope you enjoy!

The App can be found here: http://kmborchert.shinyapps.io/BurpeeApp/
